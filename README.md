# ClrLarn


This is a port of Larn http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_(video_game) a rogue like game written originally by Noah Morgan in 1986. I spent far too long playing this many years ago on a whitechapel MG1 at university.

This version is aiming to be a compatible port of Larn from the NetBSD source. I'm hoping to make this work on both windows with either a WPF or console based interface. The console version should give the most "authentic" experience.

**Note** This is an experimental project for me. Part of this is to play around with ReactiveUI, current MVVM techniques, the PCL and some testing stuff. Hopefully I end up with something that is truly cross platform code (once I add some Xamarin love) but this is just a hope currently.
