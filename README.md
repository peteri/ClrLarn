ClrLarn
=======

This is a port of [Larn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_(video_game)) a rogue like game written originally by Noah Morgan in 1986. I spent far too long playing this many years ago on a whitechapel MG1 at university.

This version is aiming to be a compatible port of Larn from the NetBSD source, it's also an experiment in test driven development and code coverage.

I'm hoping to make this work on both windows with either a WPF or console based interface. The console version should give the most "authentic" experience.
